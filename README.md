# Sales-Performance-Analysis-of-Superstore
This project utilizes Tableau to construct a dynamic dashboard that effectively illustrates key sales performance indicators. By aggregating and visualizing data related to regional sales, customer segment distribution, and temporal sales trends, the dashboard provides actionable insights. The interactive design allows for granular exploration, enabling users to identify critical patterns and potential areas for strategic optimization. This repository contains the Tableau workbook (.twb or .twbx) and serves as a tool for understanding and improving sales strategies.
